# Notesy
Notesy is a Firefox browser extension that helps users take better notes while browsing the web. 

Notesy allows users to create notes for specific web pages. When the user navigates to that web page, the notes appear.

Along with allowing users to create notes local to the current webpage, users can create notes global to all webpages.

- Turn notes into sticky notes within web browser.
- Store notes in a MongoDB server.
- Share note content through email.
